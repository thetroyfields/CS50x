                    "Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software
                    Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioner’s point of view to tens
                    of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice
                    of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill 
                    within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmer―but only if you work at it."

                    "What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code―lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it.
                    More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft."

                <blockquote>
                    Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code.
                    The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code―of
                    transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies.
                    The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.
