open CSV file and DNA sequence & read contents into memory
    first column has name, then STRs for each of the remaining columns

    *reader and dictReader
    *sys.argv for command-line arguments
    *open text file using open(file) -> read its contens using f.read()

for each STR, compute longest consecutive repeats in the sequence
    for each position in the sequence: compute how many times the STR repeats starting at that position
    for each position, keep checking successive substrings until the STR repeats no longer
    update longest sequence

    *len(s)
    *s[i:j] takes the string s, and returns the substring with all characters from the i'th character up to
     but not including the j'th

compare the STR counts against each row in CSV file
    save STR counts in some data structure
    for each row, check if each STR count matches. print out person's name
